  'QRBot is a library to simplify QR code scanning and generating new QR code tasks. You just need to make our class as super class of your ViewController and conform one protocol to scan QR Code using your app. And for generating new Code from your data, you need to call one method. We made these complex tasks that easy for you. :)'
